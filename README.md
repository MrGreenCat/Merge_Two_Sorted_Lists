# Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists

This project provides a Python solution for merging two sorted linked lists into one sorted list. The solution is implemented using basic linked list operations.

### Problem Description

You are given the heads of two sorted linked lists `list1` and `list2`. The task is to merge these two lists into one sorted list by splicing together the nodes of the first two lists.

### Examples

Input:   list1 = [1, 2, 4],   list2 = [1, 3, 4]

Output:   [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]

### Solution

The solution involves creating a new linked list by comparing the nodes of the two input lists and appending the smaller node to the new list. This process continues until all nodes from both lists are merged into the new list.
